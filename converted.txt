Joe was born and raised in Arkansas. He moved to the West Coast at the age of 20. He was thrown out
of the family home after getting to a confrontation with his brother. Joe said he was abused at a young
age but did not want to elaborate on the kind of abuse he suffered. From time to time, Joe said he gets
angry at the slight inconvenience which cause him go into rants and outbursts which last for 5 – 10
minutes at a time. He said this started happening right before he became a teenage and occurred ever
since. He said these outbursts have caused a strained on many of the relationships he had developed
over his lifetime. They have caused him to be suspended from school, lose jobs, be homeless, and
destroyed other personal relationships. As a result, Joe said he has only two friends, Bob and Lisa, who
are neighbors who live close to him.
Physical Health
Joe appears older than his stated age. He has had open sores on various parts of his body in the past
because he has not always bathed regularly. However, now he seems to be taking care of himself and
was dressed relatively well for the setting. He was cooperative in the interview answering all questions
politely. Although today, his memory showed slight signs of impairment. His mood was both anxious and
defensive as result of his diagnosis.

Drug History and Current Pattern of Use
Joe said he first began experimenting with drugs at the age of 12. He drank alcohol every weekend and
smoked marijuana on an almost daily basis throughout his teens.
At 20 Joe told me he began drinking heavily and experimenting with Ecstasy. At 24, he was introduced to
methamphetamine that became his sole drug of choice, in addition to having an occasional drink. He
said he would smoke it 3-6 times a week. However, over the last 5 years he has been trying to stop his
drug use by and has checked himself into drug rehab several times. Although he has done this, he has
not managed to stay clean consistently. During his clean times when he has not done
methamphetamine, Joe has smoked cigarettes to cope with his struggle.
Substance Abuse Treatment History
When he first started out, he was in recovery at a center in California for about a month five years ago.
Once after being arrested in New Jersey for possession of methamphetamine, he entered a local detox
center. At that time, he successfully completed its twenty-one day Rehabilitation Program. He did not
follow up with aftercare or NA meetings. After testing positive for methamphetamine at probation, Joe

was admitted to another detox facility for five days. He must complete an Intensive Outpatient Program
or he will face a three-year prison term.
Medical History and Treatment
When he was young, shortly after turning age 13, he was hospitalized at the University of Arkansas
Medical Center and diagnosed with a bipolar disorder due to one of having an outburst with a total
stranger on the street. Usually, when this has occurred in the past the situation has been de-escalated
without any further action being taken. As well to assist with treatment, Joe was prescribed a daily
dosage of 50mg of Cymbalta.

Three years later, Joe has a lapse because he felt he no longer needed to take his medication and was
readmitted to the University of American Medical Center after getting to a physical fight with his sister.
He broke her collar bone and was on the verge of doing much more harm to her. Several weeks after
this incident, Joe was discharged but while there was given lithium and again 50mg of Cymbalta for
treatment.

Joe has been hospitalized on occasion over the last 17 years when Joe has not taken his medication or
when a situation becomes really overwhelming.

a girlfriend but she left as well for the same reason. In addition, the relationship was strained as well due
to Joe’s drug use and infidelity.

place of employment started in 2007 at a restaurant in California. He worked there for two years.
However, over the past seven years Joe has been fired from ten different places of employment for
excessive outbursts and once for stealing. He said that most of these places were at nuisance bars but
still believed this would happen anywhere he worked because of his past altercations. Last year, Joe’s
lost his job because he refused to listen to his employer and continued to things on his terms. This lead
to a confrontation and was seen as insubordinate behavior by his employer.
Diagnosis
AXIS I: Bipolar Disorder
Substance Use: Methamphetamine
Joe’s affect was appropriate to content; he was not overly emotional but reasonably distressed over his
current situation. His rate of speech was somewhat rapid when addressing stressful subjects, but
otherwise normal. His tone was average throughout the interview. His thought processes were logical;
yet he did not consistently demonstrate proper insight as to his own actions and how they contributed
to his situation. He denied any current hallucinations; however, he admitted to smelling something
burning and hearing police sirens but after asking others realized they didn’t exist. This has usually
happened when he been under the influence of methamphetamine.
